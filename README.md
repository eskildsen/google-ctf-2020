Please write your solutions in here - a separate file for each. Also state how you did it in broad terms, then we can elaborate later.

These are our writeups for the Google CTF 2020 event. We participated as the team [Kalmarunionen](https://capturetheflag.withgoogle.com/scoreboard/kalmarunionen) which ended up solving 10 challenges leading to a 47th place.
